                                                E-Commerce Workflow

This document explains the step-by-step workflow of setting up and managing an e-commerce system using APIs, Sanity CMS, and frontend integration.

Step 1:My Website

 Home Page: The user lands on the home page of the website.
 Product Listing Page:
  - Displays a list of available products.
  - Fetches product data dynamically from the backend.
  - Includes search, sort, and filter options to enhance user experience.

Step 2:Product Detail Page

 Displays detailed information about a selected product.
 Data includes:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Description
  - Images
  - Additional features or specifications (if any).
  - Fetches product data using an API or CMS (Sanity).


Step 3:API Integration

 API Purpose: To fetch product details from a backend server.
 Example API Structure:

json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Chair",
  "price": 120,
  "description": "Comfortable wooden chair",
  "image": "chair.jpg"
}


 API Endpoint Example:
  - GET `/api/products` - Fetches a list of products.
  - GET `/api/products/:id` - Fetches details of a single product.

Step 4:Sanity CMS

 Integration: Import product data into Sanity CMS for content management.
 Steps:
  1. Use the API to fetch product data.
  2. Import the fetched data into Sanity CMS.
  3. Update or edit the product details within Sanity Studio.

Step 5:Define Schema

- Sanity uses schemas to define the structure of data.
- Example Schema for Product:

javascript
export default {
  name: 'product',
  type: 'document',
  title: 'Product',
  fields: [
    { name: 'name', type: 'string', title: 'Name' },
    { name: 'price', type: 'number', title: 'Price' },
    { name: 'description', type: 'text', title: 'Description' },
    { name: 'image', type: 'image', title: 'Image' },
    { name: 'stock', type: 'number', title: 'Stock' },
    { name: 'category', type: 'string', title: 'Category' }
  ]
};


Step 6:Sanity Studio

 Sanity Studio is used to manage product data.
 Interface includes fields to:
  - Add or update product names, prices, descriptions, and images.
  - Manage stock and product categories.
  - Data is now ready to be accessed from the frontend.

Step 7:Frontend Integration

 Goal: Fetch products from Sanity and display them on the website.
 Process:
  1. Use GROQ queries to fetch data from Sanity.
  2. Dynamically populate the product listing and detail pages.
  3. Handle pagination, search, and filters in the frontend.

Step 8:Product Display

  - Display product information fetched from Sanity:
  - Image, name, price, description, stock, and category.
  - Includes an "Add to Cart" button for each product.

Step 9:Cart Page

  - Functionality:
  - Displays items added to the cart.
  - Shows a summary of the selected products with total cost.
  - Includes a "Checkout" button to proceed to payment.

Step 10:Checkout Page

  -Features:
    - Form to collect customer information:
      - Name
      - Address
      - Contact details
      - Payment information
      - "Pay" button to complete the purchase.

Step 11:Success Pag

 - Confirms that the payment was successful.
 - Includes a "Track Shipment" button.


Step 12:Shipment Tracking

 - API is called to track the shipment of the order.
 - Example Endpoint:
 - POST `/api/shipment` - Generates a tracking label.
 - Includes details like estimated delivery time and courier service.

Step 13:Label Generation

 - Final Step: Generate the shipment label through the API.
 - This label can be shared with the customer for tracking their order.

Step 14:Final Features

 -Admin Panel: Allows management of orders, inventory, and tracking.
 -Email Notifications: Sends order confirmation and shipping updates to customers.
 -Responsive Design: Ensures the website is mobile-friendly for better user experience.


--- Summary---

This workflow outlines the entire process from displaying products on the website to managing them using Sanity CMS and completing the customerâ€™s purchase journey with shipment tracking. Each step integrates backend APIs, Sanity CMS, and frontend to ensure a seamless e-commerce experience.
